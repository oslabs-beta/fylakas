## Getting Started

Fylakas expects users to have a preconfigured Prometheus server deployed within their cluster in order to display metrics. If you'd like assistance with setting up a Kubernetes cluster or with deploying Kubernetes within that cluster, [this article](https://devopscube.com/setup-prometheus-monitoring-on-kubernetes/) is a great place to start.

1. **Connect To Your Cluster**: Ensure that both your application and your Prometheus server are deployed within your cluster by using the CLI command `kubectl get all`. The result should look something like this:

   If either Prometheus or your application are not deployed within the cluster, use the link above to determine how to deploy your application and / or Prometheus within your Kubernetes cluster.

2. **Connect Your Prometheus Server to Fylakas**: On the dashboard page, within the form labeled "CONNECT," input and submit the URL to your Prometheus Server. Under the hood, this will be initialized to a variable which tells our PromController where to send the queries for the metrics you want. The value of the server URL defaults to [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).

3. **See Your Data**: Once connected, your data should be visualized within the graphics on the dashboard page. Fylakas is configured to make a request to the Prometheus Server every 15 seconds. You can configure the interval that the Prometheus Server will scrape the data by locating or creating a `prometheus.yaml` file and assigning the desired `scrape_configs`. For example:

   scrape_configs:

   - job_name: 'example-job'
     static_configs:
     - targets: ['example.com:9090'] # Replace with your target's address and port
       scrape_interval: 10s # Set the scrape interval to 10 seconds
       scrape_timeout: 5s # Set the scrape timeout to 5 seconds
